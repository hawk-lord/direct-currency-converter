Direct Currency Converter

Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2014-07-18

After installation, you'll have two new buttons in the toolbar.

Conversion is enabled or disabled by the "Toggle currency conversion" button.

The settings tab is opened by the "Open settings" button. Changed settings are saved with the "Save" button in the settings tab.
Settings can be reset to original with the "Reset" button.

Currency rates are taken from Yahoo Finance and updated when you start Firefox or when you switch currency.

Your location is used to set your default region and currency (for example Finland - euro). It is guessed using the freegeoip.net service.

If conversion does not work, it probably means that there was no reply from Yahoo or freegeoip. Try to reload the browser (F5 button).

You can convert to any existing currency as defined by ISO 4217, including precious metals, if Yahoo provides a conversion rate for the currency.

You can convert from the following currencies:
CHF Swiss franc
DKK Danish krona (and Faroese króna)
EUR euro
GBP British pound
ISK	Icelandic króna
JPY Japanese yen
NOK Norwegian krona
RUB Russian rubel
SEK Swedish krona
USD United States dollar

Special attention is given to conversion of currencies used in the Nordic countries: Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland.

The conversion is made according to a best guess. For instance, "kr" can mean SEK, DKK, NOK or ISK.
In such cases, the currency is shown in brackets after the original value: 6,67 € (60 kr [SEK]).

Amounts without units are not converted.

Currencies in PDF files shown in Firefox (using pdf.js) are converted too, if possible. Converted elements are shown with a light yellow background.

Optionally some deprecated units of measurements (such as miles and calories) are converted into SI units (such as kilometres and kilojoules).
